# About

I built this for [The COVID-19 Global Hackathon](https://covid-global-hackathon.devpost.com/). The project aims to make life easier for people in quarantine.

Nowaday, it might be quite challenging to figure out do you have enough stuff for life in isolation or not. App helps you to make an effective shopping list, avoid over-consumption and to plan the next walk to the shop!
